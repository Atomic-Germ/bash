Bash is the language that you will learn to love! Many of your everyday computer tasks can be done using the concise scripts it can produce. You will soon learn that while most things can be done through a Graphical User Interface, it can actually be vastly faster to use this powerful language!

It's a great way to automate tasks that could otherwise be laborious (think mass-renaming, or changing user permissions on a file). Thanks to Bash's long and popular history, there is also a large amount of surrounding documentation and online examples to be found - great resources for when you are stuck! 

A really good way to think about Bash is the following:

> Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter, it is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command. Because it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command execution, it is a strange language, shaped as much by history as by design.  —- Brian Kernighan & Rob Pike

Though it was first released several decades ago, Bash is still used across the world every day! From automation to stitching a project together, the language is still as versatile as it ever was. Ever typed `ls` into the Terminal? You've used Bash without even realising!

This track is to help you gain some experience in this wonderful scripting language.

**Happy Bash'ing**
